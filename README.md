Notes:
- hiearchy for boxes:
  - gameobject
    - falling object
      -object itself
       - these will have a weight variable to check if it destroys the box below
       
- have a class to randomly choose an object type and queue it to drop next
  - checks that there is no dropping box currently
    - boolean check maybe
    
    
- probably need to make it so that objects fall down at different places each time
